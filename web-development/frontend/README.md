> **Master the fundamentals.** Don't rush to React. Solid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge is crucial.

> **Learn by teaching.** Write blog posts or explain concepts to others. It solidifies your knowledge.

> **Don't compare yourself to others.** Everyone learns at their own pace. Focus on consistent progress.

> **Join a community.** Learning alone is hard. Find study groups, Discord servers, or local meetups.

> **Read other people's code.** Explore open-source projects on GitHub to see how professionals structure their code.
