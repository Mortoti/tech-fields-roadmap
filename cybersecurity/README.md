## 1️⃣ Introduction

### What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity professionals protect organizations from cyberattacks, secure networks and systems, identify vulnerabilities, and respond to security incidents. You'll think like attackers to defend against them.

### What Cybersecurity Professionals Do Daily:
- Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
- Monitor networks for suspicious activity
- Respond to security incidents and breaches
- Implement security policies and procedures
- Perform security audits and compliance checks
- Analyze malware and threats
- Train employees on security best practices
- Research new attack vectors and defenses

### Why Cybersecurity?
✅ **High demand** — Massive skills shortage globally  
✅ **Job security** — Threats never stop, neither does demand  
✅ **Excellent pay** — $70K-$150K+ average  
✅ **Constant learning** — New challenges daily  
✅ **Make real impact** — Protect organizations and people  
✅ **Remote-friendly** — Work from anywhere
