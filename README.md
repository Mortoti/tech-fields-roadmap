# 🚀 Tech Career Roadmaps

> **Your complete guide from beginner to employed.** Structured learning paths with free resources, real projects, and proven timelines for every major tech field.

**Built for:** Complete beginners • Bootcamp grads • Career switchers • Self-learners

---

## 🎯 Why These Roadmaps Work

Most learning resources dump information without structure. These roadmaps are different:

✅ **Sequential learning** — Skills in optimal order, no gaps  
✅ **Project-based** — Build real portfolio pieces, not toy apps  
✅ **100% free resources** — No paywalls to start learning  
✅ **Job-focused** — Learn what employers actually want  

**Result:** Clear path from "I want to learn tech" to "I'm getting interviews."

## 💪 The Learning Framework

```
Foundation Skills + Specialized Knowledge + Portfolio Projects + Consistency = Job Offers
```

### Core Principles

#### 🏗️ Build More Than You Consume
**❌ Tutorial hell:** Watching 100 hours of videos  
**✅ Reality:** Watch 1 tutorial → Build 3 projects → Move on

#### 📅 Consistency Beats Intensity
**❌ Burnout:** 8 hours Saturday, nothing all week  
**✅ Sustainable:** 1-2 hours every single day

#### 📝 Your GitHub Is Your Resume
**❌ Empty profile:** "I'm learning to code"  
**✅ Active profile:** 20+ projects with READMEs, consistent commits

#### 🤝 Learn in Public
**❌ Isolating:** Learning alone in your room  
**✅ Community:** Share progress, ask questions, help others

#### 🎯 Project-First Learning
**❌ Passive:** Reading documentation  
**✅ Active:** Building projects that push your limits

#### 🔄 Embrace Debugging
**❌ Frustration:** "Why won't this work?!"  
**✅ Growth:** "Every error teaches me something new"

## 🚫 Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Tutorial Hell
**What it is:** Watching endless tutorials, never building  
**Why it happens:** Feels productive, but you're not learning  
**Solution:** 
- Watch ONE tutorial
- Build THREE similar projects without help
- Only then move to next topic

### Mistake 2: Spreading Too Thin
**What it is:** Learning 5 technologies simultaneously  
**Why it happens:** Everything looks interesting  
**Solution:**
- Choose ONE path
- Master it completely
- Then expand if desired

### Mistake 3: Perfectionism Paralysis
**What it is:** Code not "good enough" to share  
**Why it happens:** Fear of judgment  
**Solution:**
- Ship projects even if imperfect
- Done > Perfect
- Everyone's first projects are messy

### Mistake 4: Comparing Your Chapter 1 to Someone's Chapter 20
**What it is:** "Everyone is better than me"  
**Why it happens:** Social media shows only highlights  
**Solution:**
- Focus on YOUR growth
- Compare yourself to yesterday's you
- Everyone starts at zero

### Mistake 5: Quitting When It Gets Hard
**What it is:** Giving up during the struggle  
**Why it happens:** Discomfort feels like failure  
**Solution:**
- Difficulty = learning
- Breakthroughs come AFTER struggle
- Take breaks, don't quit

### Mistake 6: Not Building a Portfolio
**What it is:** Learning but not documenting  
**Why it happens:** Focus on learning, not proving  
**Solution:**
- Everything you build goes on GitHub
- Write READMEs immediately
- Your portfolio is your resume
